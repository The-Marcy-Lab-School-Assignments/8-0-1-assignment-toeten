# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assests are files that are unchanging. Files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are static assests.
To generate static assests in a React project, you run "npm run build" in your project folder to generate a "dist" folder that contains our static assests.
